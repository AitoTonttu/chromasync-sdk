# Sample Lua Scripts

Chroma Sync allows you to create beautiful and reactive standalone lighting effects.

Provided are a number of samples to get you going and to help you understand how to interact with Chroma Devices.

## Installation

Chroma Sync will soon have the ability to easily create, share and install user-made scripts (similar to game integrations). Until then, it's still possible to do all this manually.

Lua scripts live within the `%appdata%\ChromaSync\scripts` folder. Chroma Sync will detect when a `.lua` file has been created or modified, and will restart all scripts.

## Issues

If Chroma Sync runs into any problems - including lua scripts - all errors are logged to `%appdata%`\ChromaSync\logs`. Please note that it may not be able to provide the specific issue, but most errors tend to be simple spelling or syntax mistakes.
